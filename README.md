Week 11 Assignment

Overview

In this assignment, you'll revisit the Hangman homework from week two and empower it with JavaScript constructors. Unlike the original front-end app, this Hangman game will run entirely with Node.js.
Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.
Instructions

Create a new GitHub repository called Week11-Hangman, then clone it to your computer.
Inside your local Week11-Hangman folder, make files called game.js, letter.js, main.js and word.js.
With the files from Step 2, you'll put together a console-based hangman app that incorporates objects, user-input and constructors in its solution.
Both letter.js and word.js should be constructor files:
word.js should contain all of the methods which will check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.
letter.js should control whether or not a letter appears as a "_" or as itself on-screen.
Your game.js file will randomly select a word for the player.
main.js will contain the logic of your app. Running it in Terminal/Bash will start the game.
The app should end when a player guesses the correct word or runs out of guesses.
Tips

Program the game one piece at a time! Break the program down into fragments rather than chipping away little by little at giant, abstract problem.
Focus on one part of the smaller problem and get some code working.
Rinse and repeat (and remember, console.log is your friend).
Try your best to deliver a working/playable game by the end of the deadline.
Submit your app whether you finish or not; if you don't show us anything then we won't be able to help you with whatever programming issues you encountered this week.
Working game > pretty dud. We're focusing on game mechanics, not just on the look and feel of your app.
One More Thing

If you have any questions about this project or about the material we covered, the instructor and your TAs are only a Slack message away.
Good Luck!
